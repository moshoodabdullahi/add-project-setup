## List of Points Checked

- Page titles (Issues Fixed) - This project title was changed to be able to distinguish between different website and to give additional explanation on your website. It is also shown in browsers' tabs when there are multiple web pages open. The page title was changed from "Portfolio" to "Abdullahi Portfolio", So as to identify it among multiple web pages.

- Image text alternatives(img alt="alt text") - (issues fixed) - The image text alternatives known as (img alt attribute) convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. It serves as a helping aid to people who are blind and use screen readers can hear the alt text read out. Some changes were made to the img alt texts, But there are different categories of alt attributes For example I changed the custom menu to menu because it's a decorative, and I changed the profile to a screenshot of tonic by giving it a more meaningful explanation through alt attributes.

- Text headings (No Issues Found) - Web pages often have sections of information separated by visual headings, for example, heading text is bigger and bold (like "Headings" right above this sentence). To make these work for everyone, the headings need to be marked up. That way people can navigate to the headings — including people who cannot use a mouse and use only the keyboard, and people who use a screen reader. I found no issue in this aspect because firstly all text that looks like a heading is marked up as a heading, the heading hierarchy is also meaningful and didn't skip levels.

- Color contrast (Issues Fixed) - The color contrast aid visibility because some people cannot read the text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and background Some people cannot read the text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and background, High contrast is required by some people with visual impairments, including many older people who lose contrast sensitivity from aging, But at the same time While some people need high contrast, for others — including some people with reading disabilities such as dyslexia — bright colors (high luminance) are not readable. They need low luminance. For example, I increase the contrast of Let's Connect from 2.31 ratio to 4.50 ratio to increase its visibility, I didn't fix the contrast of Canopy, Back End Dev, and 2015 because of its hover effect, And also I couldn't increase the contrast of contact article because increasing the contrast will change the website style completely, so no changes were made to the contact article.

- Resize (No Issues Found) - Some people need to enlarge web content in order to read it. Some need to change other aspects of text display: font, space between lines, etc. And also When pages are not designed properly, they can be unusable when the text size is changed, especially when it is changed through text-only zoom or text settings. Sometimes columns and sections overlap, the space between lines disappears, lines of text become too long, or text disappears. No issue was found concerning resize, everything still looks good when zooming to 200% but it makes use of the media query.

- Interaction (Issues Fix) - Interaction between Keyboard access and visual focus helps in the sense that many people cannot use a mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web. People who are blind and some sighted people with mobility impairments rely on the keyboard or on assistive technologies and strategies that rely on keyboard commands, such as voice input. Accessible websites enable people to access all content and functionality — links, forms, media controls, etc. — through a keyboard. For Example, the input border was changed from white to blue with the use of a focus pseudo-class that when clicked on it will bring up the border given to it.
